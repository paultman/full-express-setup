# Full Expressjs Setup
This repo follows a guild on my blog for setting up a full Expressjs project  

It is based on a npm-starter-vcs which focuses on setting up a bare VCS project using a styleguide and basic VCS configuration.

All configuration is local to the project itself.
See the blogpost at https://paultman.com/setup-visual-studio-code-on-an-m1-mba-in-2021/

Feel free to use this as a project starter and update it for your own project by:
- Cloning the repo into your own project directory
ie: git clone https://github.com/paultman/npm-starter-vcs.git  my-own-project
- CD into your repo and remove my initial git repo by running: rm -rf .git
- Initialize your own git repo: git init .
- Update the readme.md and package.json files to reflect your information and unique project.
- Add all files to your local repo: git add .
- Do your first commit to your newly created repo: git comit -m "initial comit for my own project"
