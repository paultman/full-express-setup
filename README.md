# Full Expressjs Setup

This repo follows a [guide](https://paultman.com/expressjs-proj-setup-0-intro/) on my [blog](https://paultman.com) for setting up a full Expressjs project.

It is based on a npm-starter-vcs which focuses on setting up a bare VCS project using a styleguide and basic VCS configuration. See that project for how to delete history and make your own git project based on the the starter files.

### This is part of an ongoing series of articles for setting up a full client/server Express based node application.</p>
